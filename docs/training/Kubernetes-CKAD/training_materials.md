## Courses

- [Introduction to Kubernetes (LFS158x)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/introduction-to-kubernetes/)
- [Udemy - Kubernetes Certified Application Developer (CKAD) with Tests](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-application-developer/)

    Initial thoughts:

    - There is repetitive material here and one can tell that it was created a few versions prior and being reused.
    - The KodeKloud "tests" are quite simple, but allow one to use the k8s environment to expand the knowledge and "play".
